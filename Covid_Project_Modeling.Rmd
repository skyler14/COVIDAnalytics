## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
c.data = read.csv("Covid19-FinalData.csv", header=T)
str(c.data)
c.data$Week = as.factor(c.data$Week)

```


```{r, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
