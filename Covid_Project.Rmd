## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
c.data = read.csv("data/Covid19-FinalData.csv", header=T)
str(c.data)

c.data$Year = as.factor(c.data$Year)
c.data$Week = as.factor(c.data$Week)
head(c.data)

```


```{r, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
#poisson
#we should instead create a weekly baseline trend indexed by state rather then treat each week as 
#then test for seasonal (my impression is those are small) and see if we can just collapse 
#the deaths to a weekly baseline with std deviation
c.glm_p = glm(Deaths~Week+Covid+PopDensity+Population+Year+TAVG,
data=c.data, family=poisson)
summary(c.glm_p)

print("The AIC of Poisson Log linear Model is  ")
AIC(c.glm_p)
print("The BIC of Poisson Log linear Model is ")
BIC(c.glm_p)
```


```{r, include=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
#Poisson with RE

library(lme4)
m.re1 = glmer(Deaths~Week+Covid+PopDensity+Population+Year+TAVG+(1|State),
data=c.data, family=poisson)
summary(m.re1)

print("The AIC of Poisson Log linear Model with different Intercepts is  ")
AIC(m.re1)
print("The BIC of Poisson Log linear Model with different Intercepts is ")
BIC(m.re1)



```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
